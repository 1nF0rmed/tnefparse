tnefparse - TNEF decoding and attachment extraction
===================================================

This is a pure-python library for decoding Microsoft's Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF), for Python
versions 2.7, 3.5+ and PyPy.

For more information on TNEF, see for example `wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Neutral_Encapsulation_Format>`_. The full TNEF specification
is also available as a `PDF download <https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OXTNEF/[MS-OXTNEF].pdf>`_.

The library can be used as a basis for applications that need to parse TNEF. To parse a TNEF attachment, run eg. :

 >>> from tnefparse import TNEF
 >>> with open("tests/examples/one-file.tnef", "rb") as tneffile:
 ...    tnefobj = TNEF(tneffile.read())

The parsed attachment contents are then available as TNEF object attributes:

* signature - TNEF file signature
* key - generated by TNEF enabled transports before using the TNEF implementation to generate a TNEF stream
* codepage - a Windows code page string
* objects - a collection of `TNEFObject` instances
* attachments - a collection of `TNEFAttachment` instances
* mapiprops - a collection of MAPI properties represented by `TNEFMAPI_Attribute` instances
* body - message body (may contain both HTML and RTF)
* htmlbody - a string containing just the HTML message body 
* rtfbody - just the RTF body

See the TNEF class source the for full details. Some of the above properties may be empty, depending on what's contained in the attachment that was parsed.

A :code:`tnefparse` command-line utility is also provided for listing contents of TNEF files, extracting attachments found inside them and so on.

Use :code:`python setup.py test` or :code:`python runtests.py` to run the tests.

Issues and pull requests welcome. **Please however always provide an example TNEF file** that can be used to demonstrate the bug or desired behavior, if at all possible.

**Note: If you have understanding of TNEF and/or MIME internals or just need this package and want to help with maintaining it, I am open to giving you commit rights. Just let me know.**
